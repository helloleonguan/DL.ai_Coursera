# Special applications: Face recognition & Neural style transfer 

## Learning Objectives 
* Discover how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!

### 1. Face Recognition 
* face verification vs. face recognition

* challenges: 
	* a) training set is extremely small
	* b) not very extendable
* __similarity function__
