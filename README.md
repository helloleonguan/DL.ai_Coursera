# Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera  

This is a specialisation repository storing all the notes (along with some screenshots from the lectures) I have taken of the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

#### All coding assignments are in the form of _iPython Notebook_ which are hosted on Coursera Hub.  
_Notice that there won't be any code for the programming assignments in this repo because it will be a direct violation of the Honour Code._  
However, common practices, notes and thoughts regarding the assignments will be documented in MarkDown files. 
  
#### The specialisation contains the following five courses: 
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning - [Course 1 certificate](https://github.com/helloleonguan/DL.ai_Coursera/blob/master/Course1_Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning/Course_1_certificate.pdf) 
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization - [Course 2 certificate (not completed)]() 
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects - [Course 3 certificate (not completed)]() 
4. Convolutional Neural Networks - [Course 4 certificate (not completed)]() 
5. Sequence Models - [Course 5 certificate (not completed)]()
