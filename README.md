# Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera  

This is a specialisation repository storing all the notes (along with some screenshots from the lectures) I have taken of the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

_Notice that there won't be any code for the programming assignments in this repo because it will be a direct violation of the Honour Code._ 
  
#### The specialisation contains the following five courses: 
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning]()  
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization]()  
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects]()  
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks]()  
5. [Sequence Models]()
