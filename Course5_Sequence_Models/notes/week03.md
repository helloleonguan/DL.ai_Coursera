# Sequence models & Attention mechanism  

## Learning Objectives 
* Sequence models can be augmented using an attention mechanism. This algorithm will help your model understand where it should focus its attention given a sequence of inputs. This week, you will also learn about speech recognition and how to deal with audio data.  

### 1. Sequence to Sequence Model 
* use a encoder & a decoder
